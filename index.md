# How are people connected?

## Abstract
In the following project, we want to establish a graph of relationships between speakers and people mentioned in the quotations. Our motivation is to find out if those relationships can be clustered according to certain conditions. Predominantly, we will analyse the role of occupations among citations from various nationalities, dates and genders. At first, we extract the referred names from each quotation using the SpaCy model. We then make a preliminary analysis on the extracted names and their occupation distribution. Subsequently, we select additional variables to use for a meaningful clustering. We present the found relationships between speakers and referred persons on a graph, whose nodes the clusters and edges represent the “has mentioned” relationship.


## Research Questions
1: Do certain speakers (e.g: politicians) tend to address other professions (e.g: actors) in their speech? Can this proportion be linked to geographical features, i.e., are people with certain professions more likely to talk to people with the same or other professions in other countries?

2: How are women represented in these professions? In which occupations are women most likely to be referred to? Are men and women more likely to talk to each other within or across borders ?

3: How do these relationships evolve over time - do we find the same connections in 2015 as in 2020 ?
